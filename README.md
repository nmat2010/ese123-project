# ese123-project
This is a hardware project from my freshman course at Stony Brook University. I designed, coded, and soldered electrical components to create a functional clock. 
Course name: ESE 123 - Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (by Prof. David Westerfield)
There are 2 code files:
1. main.c: The main codes in C with pre-built functions.
2. functions.h: The function file where most of the functions are built.

Throughout this course and the process of developing this project, I learned and gained a lot of knowledge and experience in electrical components, circuit flow, and design. I also learned crucial and interesting skills like soldering and C programming. Moreover, I worked with different hardware tools like the Oscilloscopes, DMM, breadboard, etc.
